<font size="+2">LuxSDK Map Generator Info</font>
<P>
Contained herein is all the info you need to write a map generator plugin for Lux.
<P>
<B>The LuxMapGenerator Interface</b><BR>
Lux is written in Java, and each MapGenerator is just a class that implements the LuxMapGenerator interface. The interface comes with comments, and should probably be the first thing you examine. You can have the <a href="src/com/sillysoft/lux/LuxMapGenerator.java">source</a> or <a href="javadocs/com/sillysoft/lux/LuxMapGenerator.html">javadoc</a>.
<P>
If you are unfamiliar with java interfaces, it is basically just a list of function prototypes. To write a class that implements the interface, you just fill in the code for all of the prototypes.
<P>
<B>The MapLoader class</b><BR>
Other then the LuxMapGenerator interface, MapGenerators have to know about the MapLoader class. It contains some functions that your MapGenerator can use. You can see the <a href="javadocs/com/sillysoft/lux/MapLoader.html">javadoc</a> or <a href="src/com/sillysoft/lux/MapLoader.java">stub</a> of this class.
<P>
<B>Examples</b><BR>

<ol><li>RandomMapGenerator (<a href="javadocs/com/sillysoft/lux/RandomMapGenerator.html">javadoc</a> or <a href="src/com/sillysoft/lux/RandomMapGenerator.java">source</a>) is the class that Lux uses to create the built-in tiny-huge maps. AKA the "potato-shape" generator.
<P>
<li>ExternalMapGenerator is a class that delegates all of the work to the accompanying perl script 'luxmap.pl'. You must make sure that the script is executable for it to work (chmod 755 luxmap.pl)
<P>
<li><a href="src/org/mcglynns/lux/CastleInfinity.java">CastleInfinity</a>, <a href="src/org/mcglynns/lux/HexInfinity.java">HexInfinity</a>, and <a href="src/org/mcglynns/lux/IslandInfinity.java">IslandInfinity</a> are map generators written by Greg Mcglynns.
</ol>
<P>
<B>To Compile</b><BR>
In order to compile your LuxMapGenerator class, you must have a java compiler on your computer. The SDK comes with an apache ant build file that you can use, or you can copy the src files into your preferred IDE.
<P>
<B>Installing</b><BR>
Once you have finished writing a MapGenerator, place your compiled .class file into ~/Library/Application Support/Lux/MapGenerators/ (for Mac OS X users) or into the Support/MapGenerators/ folder where you installed Lux (i.e. C:/Program Files/Lux/Support/MapGenerators/). Your MapGenerator choices should now appear in the map selection menu the next time you run Lux.
<P>
<b>Thank You</b><BR>
If you have any questions/comments please let me know.
