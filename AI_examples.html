<P>

The source code for all of the example agents come included with this SDK inside the 'src/com/sillysoft/lux/agent' directory. You are free to use this code for non-profit purposes.
<P>
The example AIs aren't HTML formatted, so I won't link to them. They are all java classes with lots of comments. Meant to be viewed in your text editor of choice.
<P>
I recommend that you look at Angry.java first for an example of a simple agent. That should give you a good idea of how  agents interact with Lux's API.
<P>
After that, you probably want to take a gander at SmartAgentBase.java which is a utility superclass used by all of my more advanced agents.
<P>
Cluster.java is a good example of a subclass of SmartAgentBase. The general strategy of Cluster is to work on expanding a cluster of Countries. Subclasses improve on his behavior by limiting their attacks, or trying to focus them better. Subclasses of Cluster include: Shaft, Quo, Yakool, and Boscoe.
<P>
Pixie.java is based on a totally different premise from the Cluster-family. She examines each continent seperately, and decides which ones she has a chance of taking over. Then she will place armies and attack in those continents. EvilPixie and BetterPixie use the same technique as Pixie, with BetterPixie being the most advanced.
<P>
Killbot.java is an agent that uses the behavious of Vulture.java to eliminate weak players. Killbot pairs up Vulture and BetterPixie behaviour.

<P>
I am not an AI researcher or anything like that, so I haven't tried out any of the classical AI methodologies. Most of my agents are simply based upon my personal strategies for playing Risk.
